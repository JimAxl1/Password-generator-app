### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Sass
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React SOLID principles

### Continued development
I would like to improve in code, be a better developer and learn more tools about frontend.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - It helped me to solve some problems during the development of the components that included the tag 'input' and the pseudoclasses in css
